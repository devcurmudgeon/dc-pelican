title: On time and on budget - yeah right!

Developing complex software well is actually very difficult to do.

Seems to me it requires intelligence way above average, combined with enough pig-headedness to refuse to be defeated by dumb chips and other people's code spitting random error codes at you - often for hours or days at a time.

It's made worse by businesses and managers with no real clue what software engineering actually is, and swathes of <strike>hackers</strike> "software engineers" hiding behind a smokescreen of methodologies and technobabble.

So with that perspective in mind ... here's my first <strike>rant</strike> public sacrifice...


Everybody says "we deliver on time and on budget". <strike>Don't make me laugh!</strike>

Strangely, the only time I ever saw a project come in on time and on budget was when we <strike>bribed the team</strike> offered a completion bonus. Most projects are late, over budget and would benefit from a complete re-write.

There, I've said it.

I feel better now.
