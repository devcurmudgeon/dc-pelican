title: Picking a fight...

Maybe I'm alone on this one ... but aren't Open Source and Agile pretty much directly opposed?

Agile = 5-9 people in a team, locked up together, everything thrashed out in face-to-face conversations, daily standups, timeboxed iterative deliveries.

Open Source = no fixed team size, distributed around the world, everything thrashed out via email and irc, hackfests, deliveries determined by demand and programmer bandwidth.

There is <b>some</b> overlap: agilists are usually happy to <strike>take</strike> use Open Source software, and many open sores hackers work on Agile projects... not normally by choice, of course:-)

Here's a prediction for ya...  in 5 years time, there'll be MORE Open Source, and LESS Agile
