title: People vs Processes and Tools

I recently attended a demo of a software tool for _requirements management_.
After a few minutes showing the menus and screens, the demo became a
presentation of a slide deck _about_ the software.

It turned out that the engineer demonstrating the tool does not use it himself.
His weapon of choice for requirements management is ** a spreadsheet! **

_Do as I say, not as I do_.

Think of all of the situations where:

* person/team/project doesn’t follow ‘the process’ 
* person/team/project misuses or avoids using ‘the mandated/expected toolset’

... which boil down to an underlying **us vs them** anti-pattern:

* _**we** are recommending/specifying the right thing, but **they** are doing
the wrong thing_

Now, it seems to me there are only a few core reasons why someone would
_do the wrong thing_:

* They don’t realise it is wrong: lack of experience, information, training,
or brainpower
* They realise but don’t care: misaligned motivation or incentive
* They believe that what we  call ‘the right thing’ is actually the wrong
thing

So for any given tool/process, maybe:

* people are unaware of it, unable to find it, or unable to login to it
* people do not understand it
* people think it is broken, inefficient, over-complicated or not applicable
* it is **actually broken, inefficient, over-complicated or not applicable**

That’s a whole set of potential blockers which can cause people to
conclude that

**...the right thing is to ignore the specified tool/process**. 

If we awant people to actually follow our guidance, we need to remove all the
blockers. So I suggest that any tool/process we specify/recommend needs to
satisfy all the following:

* easily discoverable; it is obvious how and where to find it
* easy to understand and well documented; fast learners can figure most of it out
for themselves
* accessible with minimum friction e.g. no waiting hours/days/weeks for a login
* works as described, and is generally applicable, efficient and fit for purpose

Maybe we should stick to pushing only 
**the tools and processes we actually use ourselves.**
