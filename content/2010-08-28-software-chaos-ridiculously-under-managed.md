title: Software Chaos Ridiculously Under Managed

So this post is just a place-holder for me to launch my new methodology - SCRUM.

I'd hate to have some fan copy my ideas (again) and find myself unable to prove categorically that I thought it first, so here goes...

Google tells me (so it must be true) that no-one else has ever put these five words together in this order before. As of today the only entry is my previous post...

![Google result for "Sofware Chaos Ridiculously Under Managed"](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_pOkKszr85c4/TH_bpi0TotI/AAAAAAAAGAg/9PF0Tn2vH2w/s400/SCRUM-first-proof.jpg)

Which is strange, because I think that Software Chaos Ridiculously Under Managed (ie SCRUM, (c) DevCurmudgeon 2010) may soon be the most popular software methodology in the world, for two reasons:

1. Look at how many folks (especially managers) are talking about SCRUM, as opposed to Scrum (Schwaber/Sutherland)

2. Look at how many folks are applying the "self-managing teams idea" from the various Agile camps, while misunderstanding the implications - that's a recipe for SCRUM, right there.

I feel a book coming on... conferences, speaking engagements... I could be like [why the lucky stiff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff), with better jokes...

my code is worse, though ... _why's code rocks.

I wonder what _why thinks about SCRUM?
