title: The software commandments
date: 15/07/2011

OK, I admit it - some of the Agile thinking *did* influence the recent [Software Commandments 2.0 update](http://codethink.co.uk/commandments). 

I accept short timeboxed sprints. 

Agreed definition of DONE - great.

Prioritised list of requirements - awesome.

Daily standups - fine if you are all in the same room, and you stick to the rules. 

But 


+ I *still* recommend engineers write stuff down <strike>to cover their asses</strike> for clarity.

+ Scaling Agile to hundreds/thousands of engineers is <strike>impossible</strike> extremely challenging, potentially disastrous. 

+ You shouldn't bundle UX design in with software development.

+ I'm not buying self-managed teams - intelligent leadership and benevolent dictatorship beats democracy imo. 

And the pigs vs chickens stuff is still nonsense.
