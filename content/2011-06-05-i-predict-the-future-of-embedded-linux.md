title: I predict the future of embedded Linux
date: 05/06/2011

I've been reading the excellent <i>Future Babble</i> by Dan Gardner. 

Perhaps unsurprisingly, it confirms that we're all wired as <b>complete idiots</b> when it comes to looking into the future.

The science shows that the more confidently someone makes a prediction, the more likely they're talking utter balls. But sadly, it also shows that the greater the <strike>bullshit</strike> confidence, the more likely folks will believe it. To compound the error, we fasten onto the hits but conveniently forget the misses. I knew I should have been a <strike>bookmaker</strike> <strike>fortune-teller</strike> <strike>politician</strike> <strike>pundit</strike> strategist. 

Which brings me to a little dilemma. I suddenly feel the need to <strike>pretend I can predict</strike> estimate how many embedded linux devices will ship over the next few years. This is pretty tough given that no-one even knows with much accuracy how many are shipping *today* - one of the <strike>weaknesses</strike> benefits of open source is you can <strike>steal it and nobody needs to know</strike> use it in devices without admitting it.

So I've been <strike>rolling dice</strike> putting together a detailed financial model, and I'm 100% <strike>crazy</strike> confident to publish the following:

* linux in vehicles to exceed 200M instances per year by 2016
* linux in toys & games to exceed 1BN per year by 2016
* linux in sensors & security to exceed 1.25BN per year by 2016

I've got loads more <strike>guesswork</strike> detailed projections which I'll be happy to <strike>share over a pint</strike> charge a fortune for. 

But the trouble is... the biggest number I can come up with in my wildest dreams is 5BN new instances per year across all markets by 2016. 

At MeeGoConf last month Jim Zemlin suggested we're heading for a TRILLION in total sometime soon... 

what gives?
