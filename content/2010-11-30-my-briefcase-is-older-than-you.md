I recently demonstrated my <strike>desperation</strike> gravitas to a roomful of undergraduates with the immortal line "My briefcase is older than you." Disappointingly they continued fiddling with their gadgets.

Even my rollercoaster antics with Prezi failed to amuse...

But the exercise was not entirely a waste of time.

A spot of digital archaeology while prepping the talk uncovered the source of my first ever opus as a programmer, from 1982.

The Sinclair Programs hack described my efforts 'almost arcade quality', and how prescient that comment proved to be. My attempts at coding have been 'almost' good enough ever since.
