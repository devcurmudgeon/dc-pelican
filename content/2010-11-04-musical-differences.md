I used to be in a band, when I still had enough hair for a stupid haircut.

We had real instruments. None of this electronic bleepy noises nonsense. We used to lug huge amplifiers everywhere, because the guitars always had to be loud enough to shake the building.

Whereas the kids today, they've got no clue, no respect for tradition.

Of course I am.
