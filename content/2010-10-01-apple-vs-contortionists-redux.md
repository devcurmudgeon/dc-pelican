Previously I asked ["Does Apple use Scrum?"...]()

An ex underling just slipped me the recipe for Apple's secret sauce....

Wanna hear? Of course you do... you too could make gazillions... but you've got to promise not to tell anybody else. 

It goes like this...

   1. Three independent design teams produce mockups....say three mockups per team...
   2. Each team doesn't get to <strike>steal</strike> re-use the others' ideas...
   3. The mockups all get hacked to pieces by Steve or underSteves...
   4. Iterate, rinse and repeat, whittling down to three...
   5. Down to one accepted mockup which is pixel perfect and complete
   6. The mockup is handed over to engineering...
   7. The self-managing engineering team do a Sprint Planning Meeting...


No, just kidding.

When engineering get the jesus mockup they do a traditional software engineering process from DFD onwards - late nights, caffeine, pizzas, threats, whips, chains... the works.
