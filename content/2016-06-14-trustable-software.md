title: Trustable Software - Help Wanted!
author: devcurmudgeon
date: 2016/06/14


For a whole load of reasons I think we need to get to trustable software, and
would appreciate comments and suggestions, preferably on the
[mailing list](https://lists.trustable.io/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/trustable-software),
which is public.

Note, I'm not "marketing" or "selling" anything here. 
The aim is to trigger interest in a cross-industry set of grown-up engineers 
and think about the hard problems we now face in this Internet of Stupid Things.
