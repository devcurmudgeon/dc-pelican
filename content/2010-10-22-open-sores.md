I need to get with the program. All these years working on secret projects with someone else's name on the mastheads have created an obvious problem - nobody knows who the hex I am.

But wait!

There's an obvious solution too.

Why don't I just take my old <strike>spaghetti</strike> code -  all the stuff I wrote, and all the stuff I paid real codejunkies to write - and shove it up the interwebs?

Get me some <strike>misspelt</strike> cool project names ... set up some web <strike>sties</strike> sites ... dot orgs are pretty cheap, especially if they're unpronounceable...

There, I'm open source.

I'll be a pillar of the "community". More lecture tours. Now all I need is a <strike>business plan</strike> <strike>business model</strike> <strike>job</strike> <strike>mug</strike> Venture Capitalist.

BTW the open source/sores mashup is not one of mine - its originator, easily my match in curmudgeonry,  granted me a non-exclusive perpetual license to use, in return for free accreditation as the first certified [SCRUM]() whistleblower.

EDIT: google says the first open source/sores publication was 2002!
